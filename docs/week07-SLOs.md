- Managed infra (GCP/AWS), IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Deployment pipelines: blue/green, canary rollout

Do

- Define SLOs for API latency, error rates, queue processing time
- Deploy platform with blue/green or canary strategy
- Set up structured logging + metrics collection

Deliverable

- SLO dashboard + alert runbooks
- Deployment graph + rollback plan
